        Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
        Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
        Were't not affection chains thy tender days
        To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
        I rather would entreat thy company
        To see the wonders of the world abroad,
        Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
        Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
        But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
        Even as I would when I to love begin.
        </p>

        <p class="speech">
        Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
        Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
        Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
        Wish me partaker in thy happiness
        When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
        If ever danger do environ thee,
        Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
        For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

        And on a love-book pray for my success?
